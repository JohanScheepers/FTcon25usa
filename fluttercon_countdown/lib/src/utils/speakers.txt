### Binding Native Plugins with Flutter and Dart

Sometimes in Flutter, you need to access a native system, library, or API that doesn’t already have a Pub package available to you, so you have to bind it yourself.  Dart and Flutter provide several different methods for leveraging native libraries and APIs: Method Channels, JS Interop, FFI to C, FFI gen to Swift and Objective-C, and JNIgen. Which one is right for your use case?  This talk will take a look at the various methods for plugin development, their benefits and drawbacks, and some gotchas you might run into when developing complex plugins.

### Using Dart FFI for Compute-Heavy Tasks in Flutter Apps

Dart is a great programming language for most apps. It's modern, strongly-typed, null-safe, and memory-safe. However, it is not particularly fast compared to other compiled languages. The solution for Flutter apps that require better performance for compute-heavy tasks is Dart Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

FFI allows functions written in different languages to be called from Dart code. This means that most of the app can be written in Dart, but specific compute-intensive tasks can be implemented in a lower-level language like C, which can be up to 5x faster.

We will cover the following topics:
- What is Dart FFI?
- What are the limitations of Dart FFI?
- How to use Dart FFI in a Flutter app
- What is the difference in performance between Dart and C in real-life examples?

### From Mobile to Web: Reusing Flutter via Multi-View Embedding

Flutter Web is rapidly maturing with features like stateful hot reload and WASM compilation, but the default full-screen application model presents challenges for integration into large, existing web platforms. While iframes offer isolation, they introduce complexities in communication, styling, and context sharing. This talk is about taking a more integrated approach: embedding multi-view Flutter apps within your host web app, using custom initialization logic instead of relying on the standard generated index.html and its associated bootstrap script.

We dive into how multi-view apps allow multiple, independent Flutter components to be initialized at runtime in different parts of an existing web application. These views can share state internally, communicate with the host via JS interop and benefit from deferred imports to reduce startup times.

This session will show a case study of how we implemented multi-view embedding at Robaws to reuse an existing feature from our mobile Flutter app within our existing web application. We discuss the benefits, such as how our Web and Flutter team could continue to work independently and how this allowed us to easily add multiple other Flutter features without overhead. We also explain why we chose having 1 multi-view app over multiple smaller apps. Furthermore, the talk goes over some unintended improvements that adopting web had to our existing mobile apps, such as better support for large tablet screens.

Finally, we go over some challenges when embedding existing features in a web app, such as URL strategies, using plugins that only support mobile platforms, etc). The talk will also include some practical approaches for easy development, such as using separate build modes (mocked standalone without embedding, local server with embedding, final hosting of static release build), handling JS interop for passing context like design tokens and localization, and managing potential CORS issues during development.

This talk is aimed at Flutter developers who want to explore the possibilities of adding Flutter to their existing web applications and will focus on less explored concepts, such as deferred imports, custom initialization and Flutter views interacting with each other and with the host web app.

### Writing better tests with less work

Many developers feel that writing tests is just busywork — a distraction from the real work of writing the code that users will run.  And they're not wrong: in too many codebases, too many of the tests really are busywork.  A busywork test doesn't meaningfully help catch bugs, and consumes effort not only to write the test but to update it again and again as things change in the codebase.

But it doesn't have to be that way.  The right techniques can make a test more effective at catching bugs now, and preventing regressions next month and next year.  The same techniques can greatly reduce the burden of maintaining tests as the codebase evolves, and make the tests easier to read, with less code, even while being more comprehensive. Done right, tests are an affordable investment today that lets your team develop faster and more confidently tomorrow, and deliver a higher-quality product.

The core techniques apply in any language or framework.  Flutter offers especially rich support for writing high-quality tests right up through the UI layer, as we'll see.

In this talk, I'll share the principles I've seen work, with practical tips and examples from real-world code:
 * How to choose what layer of API a given test should operate at (beyond the binary of "unit test" vs. "integration test"), to make it both low-maintenance and high-signal.
 * The specific tools from Flutter's rich test framework that enable writing tests at a range of different layers.
 * How to factor out the boring setup from each test case in ways that make the test easier to understand, not harder, and enable writing more tests with less code and less maintenance.
 * How to imitate Flutter's own "binding" system (a form of dependency injection) to let tests cleanly simulate network requests, your database, and all the Flutter plugins you use, and how to apply package:fake_async to manipulate time itself.
 * The package:checks library, an alternative to `expect` designed for modern Dart and backward-compatible with `expect`-style matchers.

I've put these principles into practice in Zulip, and coached numerous contributors to write high-quality tests there.  Some points are inspired by my experience in the upstream Flutter tree itself, which is relentless about testing all kinds of changes, and I'll draw examples from there too.

### Adopting native assets for cross-platform FFI plugins

Interop with dart:ffi promises to make native libraries libraries available to apps without writing full-blown Flutter plugins or dealing with platform-specific build configurations. However, dart:ffi itself offers no mechanism to actually bundle native libraries with apps, requiring complex workarounds. Dart’s upcoming native assets feature fills this gap. This talk gives an overview of that feature and how it can be adopted by packages today. Key takeaways from this talk are:

- An overview of the new @Native interop style used to call C from Dart.
- How build hooks can be used to easily compile native code across platforms.
- Which steps package authors can take to adopt native assets without breaking users.
- Features to give users more control over their native dependencies.

The talk introduces necessary concepts, but assumes basic familiarity with dart:ffi and writing Flutter plugins.

### The Fleeting Interface: Ephemeral UIs That Learn, Adapt to Context and Usage Patterns, and Vanish

Abstract
The static interface era is ending. This session explores "Fleeting Interfaces" - ephemeral UIs that intelligently evolve without explicit programming. Unlike traditional adaptive designs, these interfaces transform based on usage patterns and context, with elements appearing, adapting, and vanishing as needed. Through schema-driven architecture in Flutter, powered by Gemini for decision-making, I'll demonstrate how interfaces become living temporal experiences. Discover how combining Flutter's rendering capabilities with AI can create interfaces that respond to the fourth dimension - time - establishing a new paradigm for truly responsive digital experiences.

Session Details
See the future of UI with Flutter and Gemini AI:

* Build with behaviors, not states: Schema systems that adapt naturally
* Smart interfaces: AI-powered decisions based on how users interact
* Live demos of tomorrow's UIs:
  * Interfaces that shift with context and learn from use
  * Elements that appear when needed and vanish when done
  * Demos showing real world applications
