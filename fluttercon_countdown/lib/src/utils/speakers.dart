        "details":
            "Flutter Web is rapidly maturing with features like stateful hot reload and WASM compilation, but the default full-screen application model presents challenges for integration into large, existing web platforms. While iframes offer isolation, they introduce complexities in communication, styling, and context sharing. This talk is about taking a more integrated approach: embedding multi-view Flutter apps within your host web app, using custom initialization logic instead of relying on the standard generated index.html and its associated bootstrap script.\n\nWe dive into how multi-view apps allow multiple, independent Flutter components to be initialized at runtime in different parts of an existing web application. These views can share state internally, communicate with the host via JS interop and benefit from deferred imports to reduce startup times.\n\nThis session will show a case study of how we implemented multi-view embedding at Robaws to reuse an existing feature from our mobile Flutter app within our existing web application. We discuss the benefits, such as how our Web and Flutter team could continue to work independently and how this allowed us to easily add multiple other Flutter features without overhead. We also explain why we chose having 1 multi-view app over multiple smaller apps. Furthermore, the talk goes over some unintended improvements that adopting web had to our existing mobile apps, such as better support for large tablet screens.\n\nFinally, we go over some challenges when embedding existing features in a web app, such as URL strategies, using plugins that only support mobile platforms, etc). The talk will also include some practical approaches for easy development, such as using separate build modes (mocked standalone without embedding, local server with embedding, final hosting of static release build), handling JS interop for passing context like design tokens and localization, and managing potential CORS issues during development.\n\nThis talk is aimed at Flutter developers who want to explore the possibilities of adding Flutter to their existing web applications and will focus on less explored concepts, such as deferred imports, custom initialization and Flutter views interacting with each other and with the host web app."

        "details":
            "Many developers feel that writing tests is just busywork — a distraction from the real work of writing the code that users will run.  And they're not wrong: in too many codebases, too many of the tests really are busywork.  A busywork test doesn't meaningfully help catch bugs, and consumes effort not only to write the test but to update it again and again as things change in the codebase.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way.  The right techniques can make a test more effective at catching bugs now, and preventing regressions next month and next year.  The same techniques can greatly reduce the burden of maintaining tests as the codebase evolves, and make the tests easier to read, with less code, even while being more comprehensive. Done right, tests are an affordable investment today that lets your team develop faster and more confidently tomorrow, and deliver a higher-quality product.\n\nThe core techniques apply in any language or framework.  Flutter offers especially rich support for writing high-quality tests right up through the UI layer, as we'll see.\n\nIn this talk, I'll share the principles I've seen work, with practical tips and examples from real-world code:\n * How to choose what layer of API a given test should operate at (beyond the binary of \"unit test\" vs. \"integration test\"), to make it both low-maintenance and high-signal.\n * The specific tools from Flutter's rich test framework that enable writing tests at a range of different layers.\n * How to factor out the boring setup from each test case in ways that make the test easier to understand, not harder, and enable writing more tests with less code and less maintenance.\n * How to imitate Flutter's own \"binding\" system (a form of dependency injection) to let tests cleanly simulate network requests, your database, and all the Flutter plugins you use, and how to apply package:fake_async to manipulate time itself.\n * The package:checks library, an alternative to `expect` designed for modern Dart and backward-compatible with `expect`-style matchers.\n\nI've put these principles into practice in Zulip, and coached numerous contributors to write high-quality tests there.  Some points are inspired by my experience in the upstream Flutter tree itself, which is relentless about testing all kinds of changes, and I'll draw examples from there too."

            "Interop with dart:ffi promises to make native libraries libraries available to apps without writing full-blown Flutter plugins or dealing with platform-specific build configurations. However, dart:ffi itself offers no mechanism to actually bundle native libraries with apps, requiring complex workarounds. Dart’s upcoming native assets feature fills this gap. This talk gives an overview of that feature and how it can be adopted by packages today. Key takeaways from this talk are:\n\n- An overview of the new @Native interop style used to call C from Dart.\n- How build hooks can be used to easily compile native code across platforms.\n- Which steps package authors can take to adopt native assets without breaking users.\n- Features to give users more control over their native dependencies.\n\nThe talk introduces necessary concepts, but assumes basic familiarity with dart:ffi and writing Flutter plugins."
